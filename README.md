## Technologies

### JavaScript/Express.js/Bcrypt.js

JavaScript was used to fetch and send data to an API. It was used to create a REST API with `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete` routes for users and habits. This allowed the application to:

- fetch all habits,
- fetch a specific habit,
- fetch all users,
- fetch a specific user,
- create a new user,
- create a new habit,
- edit a habit,
- update a user's level and experience,
- delete a habit,
- and enable authentication and authorisation.

### PostgreSQL

We decided to use a relational database to hold the data for our application. This is currently hosted on Railway.
